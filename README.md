# StackRating.com
An Elo-based rating system for Stack Overflow

This web application tracks ratings for [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) users. As opposed to [reputation](http://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation), which is a cumulative measure of how much the community has appreciated a users contributions, the rating is a relative measure of a users "skill" compared to the other users.

For further information, refer to the [about page](http://stackrating.com/about).
